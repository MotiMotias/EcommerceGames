Hello, my name is Matthias De Volder and this is my project for an Ecommerce Website with an API. I did it while studying code and programming.

This project was made using React, docker, Postman and MongoDB.

For the project to work, it needs to be launched in a container with Docker so that it can call the database and the different components can communicate correctly when, for example, I needed to use the useContext function.

For the components I used Bootstrap which gave me the code for the components in the shape that I needed and then I modified or completed the code depending on what I wanted to do with the component.

I used Axios to make the request to the database with the elements I wanted to display on the website. I also used Postman to add or delete items to my database.
